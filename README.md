This is my Opengl template.So far I've plugged in the libraries: GLFW, Glad, Spdlog (for fast logging) and Imgui. GLFW, Imgui and Spdlog are compiled into .lib files and glad is in the code folder. 
I forgot to enable android implemintation when compiling Imgui, and I will fix that soon. 
To run the project you need to compile CMakeLists.txt. There is support for: Windows, Mac and Linux, I plan to add Android in the future. 
On successful compilation you should have an empty opengl window with a bluish color. Good luck!
